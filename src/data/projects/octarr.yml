    desc: Octarr is an endless 3D array system based on an octree. While working on a Godot project, I needed a way to easily store voxels in an otherwise polygonal world. This seemed like an interesting solution and an opportunity to understand how octrees work.

    desc: Soon enough I had a working iteration and could place voxel blocks in the world. The green lines show used octree nodes. Unlike multidimensional or jagged arrays, Octarr is memory friendly. You can write a data block at the 2^64 coordinate and not run out of memory. That was the main obstacle which I managed to overcome using this system.

    desc: To find a block placed at a 2^64 coordinate it takes roughly 64 octree node lookups (logarithmic complexity). A block placed that far begins to cause floating point precision errors in the debug rendering.<br><br>Feel free to check out the project's repository <a href="https://github.com/swift502/Octarr">on GitHub</a>!
