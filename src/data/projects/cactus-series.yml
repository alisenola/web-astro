    desc: A collection of 3D characters published <a href="https://skfb.ly/oyySC">on Sketchfab</a>. The purpose of this series was to get familiar with manually painting character textures on a graphics tablet. All the pieces in this series therefore utilize hand-painted textures to a greater or lesser extent. See for yourself!
