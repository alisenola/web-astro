    data: WoA originally started development on Unity's built-in rendering. In order to future proof the rendering, a decision was later made to migrate to Unity's Universal Render Pipeline, or URP.<br><br>Though the migration was successful, performance didn't map 1:1 from build-in to URP. Good ideas from built-in seemed to perform even better in URP, but the somewhat bad ideas from built-in became significant issues in URP. This caused an investigation into what could be done to improve rendering performance and if we could eliminate some of the bad rendering practices, namely rendering using multiple cameras.
