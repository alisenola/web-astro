    desc: World of Airports is a mobile airport management game. I was in charge of establishing the game's art style, creating all 3D assets, writing shaders, creating interactive minigames, and was involved in many of the game's integral systems.

    desc: Featuring a full day-night cycle, I created a custom post-processing pipeline allowing for mobile friendly night lighting. An optimised billboard shader was applied on all of the small light sources, using UV data to locate each of the light's position in 3D space, enabling render batching and saving performance.
