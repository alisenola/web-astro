    desc: Model of the Hogwarts castle. I was curious about how the castle layout changed throughout the movies, and wanted to figure out what layout or an amalgamation of layouts I liked the most. Initially based on a castle import from the Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince 2009 video game, however all parts of the castle were completely remodelled from scratch.
