    desc: Model of the Hogwarts castle. I was curious about how the castle layout changed throughout the movies, and wanted to figure out what layout or an amalgamation of layouts I liked the most. Initially based on a castle import from the Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince 2009 video game, however 90% of the castle was completely remodelled from scratch.

    desc: I did some simple texturing and material work to create a few atmospheric shots of the castle. While hardly perfect, it was a lot of fun to work on as a fan of the Harry Potter universe.
