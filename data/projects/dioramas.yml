    desc: A collection of 3D character-focused dioramas published <a href="https://sketchfab.com/swift502/collections/girls">on Sketchfab</a>. Their art style is an evolution of the techniques used in the <a href="/projects/characters">Character experiments</a> project with less restrictions on poly count, yet still striving to retain the classic low poly aesthetic.
