    desc: An experimental project focused on exploring various character designs and art styles. One of these characters eventually became <a href="/projects/chloe">Chloe</a>, which was the only character I saw through to completion.

    desc: Second iteration. More conservative color palette and more realistic proportions.

    desc: High poly renditions of few of the characters. I ultimately felt this direction was too realistic in style compared to what I originally wanted to explore, and so I eventually abandoned the project for the time being. Though I learned a lot and still intend on continuing this project some day.
